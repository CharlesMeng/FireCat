### FireCat -- Code: "Migrant Worker"

Hardware design to run FreeEMS on my Citroen ZX TU5JP/K engine. The goal is to
completely replace the stock Bosch MP5.2 ECU.

This is a project by Yu Zhou to implement a hardware design for FreeEMS. It is

#### Why is it code named "Migrant Worker"?

In China the term "Migrant Worker" especially refers to people who leave their
hometown and migrate to a more developed city such as Beijing, Shanghai,
Guangzhou or Shenzhen to earn money. As a software engineer, I have to live in
Beijing to work in my career and pursue my dream. Migrant workers usually lead
a tough life in a poor area and rent a cheap, small, nasty 'cell' to sleep in,
no windows in the room... I define myself as a advanced migrant worker. The
only thing that distinguishs me from them is that I have my private car and can
speak a little English. Hence I named my first FreeEMS hardware in this way.
