Why code name migrant worker?

Migrant worker in China especially refer to a group of people who leave their hometown and migrant to more development city such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen to earn money. As a software engineer, I have to spend my career in Beijing and pursue my dream. Migrant worker usually lead a tough life in poor people zone, rent a cheap, small, nasty 'cell' to sleep in, no windows in the room... I define myself as a advance migrant worker, I can only be distinguished from them is that I got my private car and can speak a little English. So I named my first FreeEMS hardware for this name
